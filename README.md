# Clinical-Trial-Patient-Matching-System

Problem: Build a tool that matches patients to relevant clinical trials based on eligibility criteria.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement similarity matching, criteria scoring, ranking algorithms for trial recommendations

Critical Thinking: Understand inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient benefit vs research needs, ethical considerations

Problem Solving: Handle complex medical criteria, multiple conditions, geographic constraints

Modular Structure: Separate criteria parsing, patient profile matching, scoring engine, and recommendation system

Clear Architecture: Flow from patient data + trial criteria → eligibility assessment → match scoring → ranked recommendations

Deliverable: Matching system that identifies suitable clinical trials for patient profiles.
